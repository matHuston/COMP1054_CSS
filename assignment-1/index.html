            <hr>
            <p>Around three years ago, a teen pop artist from Ohio named brakence started to experience a relentless, nagging headache that lasted for months. This chronic pain, and brakence's broader understandings of his mind, body and environment, inspired his second album, the meticulous <i>hypochondriac</i>, released in December 2022 on Columbia Records.</p>
            <p>Raised in the suburbs of Columbus, brakence enjoyed a comfortable middle class upbringing that allowed him to explore his creative tendencies from an early age. He developed his voice in choir and his knowledge of music theory in jazz piano lessons. He attended an alternative middle school that abolished grades and sent him on <q>discovery days</q> to a family friend's basement studio to record. Around that time, he sunk deeper into the internet and grew obsessed with maximal, early 2010s dubstep.</p>
            <p>These influences coalesced into brakence's early style, an undulating, head-trip beat music. In early 2020, he released his debut album <i>punk2</i>, a brash coming-of-age record whose emo pop flirted with pandemic-era hyperpop. The latter scene navigated the alienation arising from our multiple selves — online personas and real-life ones; bodies and avatars; identities at school, at home, on Discord. Across <i>hypochondriac</i>, brakence, now 20 and already a quiet influence on the scene, blurs the lines between these. Fame, relationships, stimulants, screens and psychedelics infect, pester, enhance, modify, rupture and bombard brakence's body. At different points on the album, brakence is a lump of clay, a device that needs recharging, a doomscroller with a <q>radioactive touch.</q></p>
            <p>The trick of this album is to channel these heady metaphysics through the familiar forms of pop music. Drawing from a prickly palette of IDM, emo and rap textures, brakence reaches for the <q>realer-than-real</q> feelings that stem from taking psychedelics. When songs abruptly shift tempos and veer off in surprising directions, like the mini Jersey club explosion at the end of <q>caffeine,</q> they feel less like stray experimental gestures than intentional pieces of the album's grander architecture. Through a production technique called formant shifting, brakence makes his crisp, classically trained baritone vocals expand, shrink, sprout and wither as an outgrowth of the synth plucks and bass smacks.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, brakence is but a machine <q>digging out dopamine,</q> or a <q>handmade prop</q> on stage. But other times he's in control, basking in the limelight, striving for an obsessive level of perfection as an artist. It's almost as though brakence is trying on different worldviews like clothes, seeing how they fit as he develops his own theory of the world. On sonic and conceptual levels, <i>hypochondriac</i> is a testing ground, brakence attempting to generate a fully-rendered map of himself and his environment, perhaps to ground himself amid the storms of reality.</p>

            <p>When the album that <em>Venus Fly Trap</em> is from came out, <em>hypochondriac</em>, I was in a dark place in my life. The Pandemic had wrecked a lot of things for me. Covid hit at the tail end of my first year of university and had only been diagnosed with ADHD when I was in Grade 12; I just thought school was hard for me. My medication at the time felt like it was doing nothing for me, and I was facing a lot of outside pressure to succeed. I had worked so hard to get there in the first place. I had a horrible time with online school, it felt impossible to hold myself accountable to complete my work on time, and it just started piling up.</p>
            <p>Before I knew it, I had missed so much work that even looking at it started to give me anxiety, which I had never really experienced before. And so I didn't know how to handle it. Around the same time I had gotten into a relationship with a partner who was a heavy alcoholic and, well, I became one too. We didn't stay together long, but the impact that relationship had, and the substance abuse, stuck with me.</p>
            <p>Eventually I was getting drunk all the time alone in my room in Kingston, avoiding my work, and abusing myself mentally and physically. I started binging food and drinking a 750ml bottle of whatever I could get my hands on <em>daily</em>, on top of my previous habits of being a heavy stoner, psychedelic enjoyer, and a nicotine addict. That went on for two years, still enrolled in university, lying to my parents about my grades, and drinking myself into a stupor each night while wasting a total of $16,000 in loans on an education that I didn't- couldn't- appreciate.</p>
            <p>It was around that time I started listening to music that reflected how I felt inside and out. Deeply, deeply broken. I've always been artistically talented and although I never was good at making music myself, it still holds a special place in my heart as an important piece of how I express myself and deal with my emotions. I discovered artists like glaive, ericdoa, aldn, kennedyxoxo, and more. People who were around my age, expressing their frustrations with the state of the world and their lives through song.</p>
            <p>It was brakence who really became my favorite of that era of hyperpop musicians. His melodic voice, incredible musical range in both instrumentals and vocals, the psychedelic nature of his tracks and themes, it all spoke to me on a profound level. Something happens when you hear someone echo your own thoughts over a song, I don't really know how to express what it is, but I'm sure you've experienced it before.</p>
            <p><em>Venus Fly Trap</em> reminds me of that partner, who I let take me by the hand and lead me down the path of least resistance, into a trance fueled by alcohol and drugs. To this day the very concept of Time itself feels abstract and fake to me as the days pass me by like a stranger in the night. I think of Time as my personal Grim Reaper, and He and I don't get along very well. I don't blame my ex for it though. I could have handled my pain better, I could have asked for help sooner than I did. In the end, this song reminds me not of my mistakes, it doesn't fill me with anger towards my ex; it reminds me of the places I've been, the things I've experienced, and makes me grateful of the path I walk down now.</p>
            <p>To this day I still struggle with getting a grip on my anxiety, with online classes, with checking due dates or my student e-mail. But despite it all, I'm still here. I'm breathing, I'm in a better place, and I have supports around me to catch me when I falter. I still battle with my own metaphorical demons, and with Time. But I like to think that these days, I'm finally winning, and taking my life <em>back</em>.</p>
